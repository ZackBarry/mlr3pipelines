- opt ensemble stuff does not work the way it is supposed to, because input is not PredictionData -- it is a Task (created by LearnerCV).
- learners should probably already create an S3 prediction
- ensemble stuff was never tested inside a graph
- what is the point of creating the dict at load time?
- prediction s3-object should be factor, not character
- typechecks should not happen in train() or predict() if they are already in in/output channel spec0
- pipeops dont handle prediction, only predictiondata
